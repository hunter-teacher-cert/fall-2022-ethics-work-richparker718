Hulu and Netflix


Hulu:
One thing that is good about Hulu’s privacy policy is that they do not share data with companies outside of the Disney family of companies. This is good because it limits the amount of entities that your data could possibly be exposed to.
One thing that is bad is that sensitive information is collected. This is bad because although Disney will only share with companies under the Disney umbrella, with such a big corporation like Disney, a user would have to research to find out how many places their data exists. Also, users would not be aware of new companies under the Disney umbrella that have been created.


Netflix:
One thing that is good is that user data are deleted upon termination or cancellation. This is good because if you’ve used Netflix for many years, a lot of data has been collected and would be valuable to many companies.
One thing that is bad is that data is shared with third party companies. This is bad because a user doesn’t have the immediate information to know how data are being used and who has access to it.
 
Summary:
Hulu and Netflix are two huge streaming services that through providing so much media acquire large amounts of data from users. Both companies have similar privacy policies which seem to be standard such as notifications of changes in policies and standards of protecting user data through encryption. Where there are glaring differences exist in the realm of sharing data with third-party companies. Disney shares with its own companies while Netflix shares with third-party companies outside of Netflix. Both companies have policies for users to access elements of the data collected but those are unclear and not easily/readily accessible.
