Hulu and Netflix are two huge streaming services that through providing so much distributed media acquire large amounts of data from users. Both companies have certain aspects of their privacy policies that are similar, i.e., notifications of changes in policies, and the protection of user data through encryption. Some of the differences exist in the realm of sharing data with third-party companies. Disney shares with its own companies while Netflix shares with third-party companies outside of Netflix. Both companies have policies for users to access elements of the data collected but those are unclear and not easily/readily accessible.
