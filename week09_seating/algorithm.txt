Async Week 10 - DUE 11/16 (2 weeks) 9:00pm
Repo directory: week09_seating (yes, the same directory as last week)
Note: This assignment should be done in teams of 2 or 3.
Write up a description of the algorithm you will implement as a text, pdf or md file and store it in the folder under the name algorithm.txt, algorithm.pdf or algorithm.md
Make a copy of the provided plane_seating.py in the folder and implement as much of your algorithm as you can. If you can't implement it fully, describe in the comments what you couldn't do due to either time or complexity.
If you want to start with a new plane base rather than work from the provided code (even in another language), that's fine but make sure the filename for your implementation is still plane_seating.py or plane_seathing.whatever where whatever is the appropriate language extension
 

I want to implement an algorithm that if a purchaser has a young child 0-7 and there are available seats next to each other, then assign the purchaser and child the seats
